# Music_Maestros
Academic Project Fall 2016
This project is an automatic schedule generating system to music department of my university (Northwest Missouri State U). 
The project is developed with all the modern technologies like Java, Spring BOOT, Spring MVC, Spring Data-JPA, Apache POI, HQL, 
SQL,Maven and Thymeleaf, along with client side technologies like ajax, bootstrap and Javascript.

I might enhance the app by incorporating few more features too and probably make it a generic scheduling system.

All are welcome to contibute
